# Snooker Score Pro - Setup Instructions

## 🎱 Adding Player Background Images

To enable the dramatic rivalry effect with background images:

1. Save your first snooker player image as **`player1.jpeg`** in this folder
   - This will be the background for Player A (left panel, green theme)

2. Save your second snooker player image as **`player2.jpeg`** in this folder
   - This will be the background for Player B (right panel, red theme)

## 📸 Image Guidelines

- **Recommended size**: 800x1200px or similar portrait orientation
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Quality**: High quality images work best
- The images will be automatically:
  - Slightly transparent (15% opacity, 25% on hover)
  - Slightly desaturated for better UI readability
  - Positioned at the top center
  - Scaled smoothly on hover
